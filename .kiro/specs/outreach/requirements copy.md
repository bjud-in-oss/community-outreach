### Requirement: Intuitive and Adaptive User Experience

**User Story:** As a technically inexperienced senior user, I want a digital companion that feels like a simple and safe "Digital Anteckningsbok", so that I can effortlessly capture my thoughts, create content, and collaborate with others, without ever feeling overwhelmed by the underlying technology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  **WHEN** a user interacts with the system in any view, **THEN** the system **SHALL** consistently apply the "Complexity Shield" principle by hiding all technical jargon (e.g., "RAG", "Git", "agent") and presenting its actions using simple, human-like metaphors (e.g., "tÃ¤nker", "planerar").

8.  **WHEN** a new user onboards, **THEN** the system **SHALL** guide them through a conversational flow that introduces the "Samtal" and "Sidor" metaphor, handles consent gathering, and offers to start them with a pre-built application template.

### Requirement: Adherence to Core Architectural Principles

**User Story:** As the system architect, I want the entire agent platform to be built upon five non-negotiable architectural principles, so that we create a cohesive, psychologically-grounded, and user-centric cognitive partner, not just a collection of features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  **WHEN** multiple users have given mutual and specific consent (`scope: share:memories_for_connection`), **THEN** the system **SHALL** be authorized to perform a background analysis to find thematic links between their personal narratives.
2.  **WHEN** the system is in `Autonomous Mode` (`SEP-118`), **THEN** the Coordinator agent **SHALL** be able to initiate a low-priority "Discovery" task to search for `(Event)`-nodes from different, connected users that share a common `(Theme)`-node.
3.  **WHEN** a strong thematic link is discovered (e.g., two events sharing a theme and a similar emotional context), **THEN** the system **SHALL** create a "Conversation Starter" object containing the linked memories and the shared theme.
4.  **WHEN** a relevant conversational context arises, **THEN** the Conscious Agent **SHALL** be able to present the "Conversation Starter" in a tactful and empathetic manner, following the "Mirror & Harmonize" strategy (`SEP-104`).
5.  **WHEN** sharing is enabled between user A and user B, and between user B and user C, **THEN** the system **SHALL** be strictly forbidden from showing user A's memories to user C (no transitive sharing).
6.  **WHEN** analyzing memories, **THEN** the system **SHALL** always exclude any memory explicitly marked as `visibility: private` by a user, regardless of general consent status.

### Requirement: "Empatibryggan" Application

**User Story:** As a user communicating about sensitive topics, I want my agent to act as a private, empathetic coach that helps me review my messages before sending, so that I can ensure my true intent is conveyed clearly and reduce the risk of unintentional misunderstandings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  **WHEN** two users have given mutual and specific consent (scope: `enable:empathy_bridge`), **THEN** the "Empatibryggan" feature **SHALL** be available for activation in their conversations.
2.  **WHEN** the feature is active and a message is drafted, **THEN** the Coordinator agent **SHALL** initiate a `Cortex`-level simulation to predict the likely emotional response from the recipient, using both users' communication patterns from the `Graph RAG`.
3.  **WHEN** the simulation predicts a high negative `Relational_Delta` (a likely misunderstanding), **THEN** the agent **SHALL** proactively intervene with the sender *before* the message is sent, suggesting alternative phrasing.
4.  **WHEN** the agent provides a suggestion, **THEN** the sender **SHALL** always have the final control to accept, modify, or ignore the suggestion.
5.  **WHEN** presenting a suggestion, **THEN** the agent **SHALL** be strictly forbidden from revealing specific details about the recipient's psychological model, framing its advice as neutral communication guidance (no "gossip").
6.  **WHEN** a message draft is analyzed, **THEN** it **SHALL NOT** be saved in the long-term memory (LTM).

### Requirement: "HÃ¤lsning till Framtiden" Application

**User Story:** As a user who wants to share my wisdom and memories beyond my own time, I want to create and schedule personal messages to be delivered to my loved ones at specific moments in the future, so that I can create a living, interactive legacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  **WHEN** a user is in the Personal Chronicler, **THEN** they **SHALL** be able to designate content (e.g., a story, video, or app-view) as a `LegacyContent` object.
2.  **WHEN** creating `LegacyContent`, **THEN** the user **SHALL** be guided by the agent to define a specific `(Trigger)`-node in the Graph RAG.
3.  **WHEN** defining a trigger, **THEN** the system **SHALL** support at least three types: time-based (a specific date), event-based (a milestone achieved by the recipient in the system), and query-based (a specific question asked by a future user).
4.  **WHEN** a trigger condition is met, **THEN** the agent **SHALL** initiate a tactful, permission-seeking delivery process to the recipient, respecting their current emotional state (`User_State`).
5.  **WHEN** a user creates a legacy message for a recipient, **THEN** the system **SHALL** first verify that both parties have an active, mutual consent with the scope `allow:legacy_content`.
6.  **WHEN** a legacy message is to be delivered, **THEN** the recipient **SHALL** always have the right to refuse to receive it.
7.  The system **SHALL** have a defined policy for data stewardship and the management of a user's digital legacy, including the potential role of a user-designated "digital executor".
